"""Constants, enumerations for Hypatia.

Generally, these constants and enumerations serve to replace
the usage of strings for such paramount attributes like
direction and action. The benefit of this model is:

  * enhances code clarity
  * provides type checking
  * provides constants operations, e.g.,
    `North + East = North East`.
  * class methods to convert one datatype to a constant, like
    velocity to direction

Example:
    >>> from hypatia import animations
    >>> sprite = animations.Walkabout('debug')
    >>> sprite.animations[Action.walk][Direction.east]
    <AnimatedSprite sprite(in ... groups)>

   *  :attribute:`actor.Actor.direction`
   *  :attribute:`animations.Walkabout.direction`
