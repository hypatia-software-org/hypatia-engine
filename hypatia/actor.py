"""Implementation of actors.

Actors are the base of any entities (players) which may perform
actions, examples include:

  * human player
  * an enemy NPC
  * a friendly NPC
  * an invisible NPC which simply displays
    a message when "talked" to.

This module implements a basic :class:`Actor` class to serve as
the parent for any classes representing objects such as those
examples.

Any logic which can by shared by all "players" belongs in the class,
for example, the logic for moving around the game world. This approach
makes it possible to allow, for example, enemies and players to share
much of the same behavior and this can make it easier to give monsters
the same set of core abilities and logic as NPCs, etc.

When type-checking is necessary the :class:`Actor` class provides a
useful way to test for objects which support a bare-minimum of core,
shared actions. The class is also useful in role-playing games for
storing data that tends to be common between the Player, NPCs, enemies,
etalia, a common example being statistics like hit-points.

    some dialog. These are the types of actions which are shared
    by all/most actors and therefore best implemented in this class,

    human player, enemies.
